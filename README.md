Swoosh
======

A middle-level library around the Flourish Library.

Please note that Swoosh is currently in pre-pre-alpha. I don't even guarantee that it will run at
all. It's in a state of rapid development; ***I do not suggest using it in any production
projects yet.***

This is merely a snapshot to get an idea of what Swoosh can do, and if it's the right un-framework
for you. See also: [Flourish](http://flourishlib.com), the framework that Swoosh lives upon. If you
like Flourish, you may also like Swoosh!
